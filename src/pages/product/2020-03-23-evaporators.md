  Fjell Technology Group was originally established almost 50 years ago as local
  manufacturer of evaporator stages and tube and shell heat exchangers for Stord
  Bartz, and produced many hundred stages until year 2000.  Since then we have
  designed, manufactured and commissioned many complete evaporator systems, both
  WHE and our unique Forced Flash Finisher.

  Today we focus on cookers and dryer technology, and have chosen to cooperate
  with EPCON Evaporation Technology AS for deliveries of MVR Evaporators, and
  promotes their excellent high grade technology to our customers.
