description2: >-
  An all in one complete wastewater treatment system. The wastewater is
  structured through use of coalgualants and polymer before it enters the first
  bandfilter which thicken the sludge to approximate 5% drymatter content (DM).
  The sludge then enters a second bandfilter which dewaters the sludge to above
  20% DM.
infobox2: >-
  A proven system with the highest capture rate in the market. Can be used both
  for wastewater from fishfarms as well as wastewater from slaughterhouses and
  processing plants. 


  Each separation system module with 20 m3 per hour treatment capacity and each
  module work separate from the other modules.
