  ## Design


  All equipment designed and engineered to fit in tigh locations as on vessels
  but also on smaller locations on land. 


  Fjell cooperate with pultiple partners to offer the best available
  technologies assembled together as compactly as possible without compromising
  quality. With FTG's solution for a compact fishmeal plant, it will be possible
  to place the plant in the immediate vicinity from the slaughteries and ensure
  optimum quality of raw material.


  The compact solutions most often consists of grinder, boiler, press,
  decanter/tricanter, dryer, hammermill and cooler. FTG process solution ensure
  the optimum trade-off of size, quality on materials and energy effectiveness. 


  **Description**


  Grinding as a first step ensures that even bits of residue are passed on - and
  not least is the first barrier to fishing hooks and other elements that are
  not wanted in the further process


  The screw cooker is designed as a large slowly rotating screw conveyor with
  steam heated outer pipe and hollow steam heated flighting allowing heating of
  the raw material to about 90°C to secure complete coagulation. 


  Depending on layout coagulated material is then pressed through a screwpress
  for squeezing out liquids, and the press cake is dropped or conveyed directly
  into the drier.


  The liquid from the press is directed to the tricanter, which in one single
  step is able to separate the liquid into solids, stickwater and fish oil. 


  Oil can be further treated in a polisher for optimum quality.


  Evaporating of stickwater are optional but recommended to take out the last
  6-7% protein that is water soluble and thus valuable as they provide a better
  quality of the meal.


  The drier evaporates the water from the solids. The combination of gentle
  rotation and evaporations result in a fishmeal with approx. 10 % residual
  water.


  Vapour from the driers is drawn out and treated in a seawater scrubber
  together with ventilation air and vapour from the other process equipment.
  (optional)


  Warm and bony fish meal is conveyed to the hammer mill before cooling and
  transporting to meal silo as reservoir for bagging.  Transport may be by means
  of cooling screw conveyors or pneumatic system.

  Typical compact plants have a capacity range of between 15 to 250 tons of raw
  materials per day.

  ## Legacy


  In the year 2000 Fjell Technology Group AS decided to develop a robust and
  energy efficient disc dryer specially designed for modern manufacturing
  methods like robotic welding. We had a competent staff with senior personnel
  having experience from design, manufacturing and installation of about 2000
  Stord dryers since the introduction of the technology, wich took place in the
  late 50ies. 


  We added some young innovative engineers skilled in state of the art
  engineering design and analysis techniques. The result was the Fjell Turbo
  Disc Dryer with a unique patented disc design, based on efficient
  manufacturing techniques.
