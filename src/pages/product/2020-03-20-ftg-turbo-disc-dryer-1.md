  ## Design


  The equipment is designed and engineered to fit in tight locations, which
  makes it perfect for vessels, as well as smaller locations on land. 


  Fjell cooperate with multiple partners to offer the best available
  technologies assembled as compact as possible without compromising the
  quality. With FTG's solution for a complete fishmeal plant, it will be
  possible to place the plant in the immediate vicinity from the slaughteries
  which ensures optimum quality of raw material.


  The small sized solutions usually consists of grinder, boiler, press,
  decanter/tricanter, dryer, hammermill and cooler. FTG process solution ensure
  the optimum trade-off of size, quality on materials and energy effectiveness.

  **Description**


  Grinding as a first step ensures that even bits of residue are passed on - and
  is important as the first barrier to fishing hooks and other elements that are
  not wanted in the further process.


  The screw cooker is designed as a large slowly rotating screw conveyor with
  steam heated outer pipe and hollow steam heated flighting allowing heating of
  the raw material to about 90°C to secure complete coagulation. 


  Depending on layout coagulated material is then pressed through a screwpress
  for squeezing out liquids, and the press cake is dropped or conveyed directly
  into the drier.


  The liquid from the press is directed to the tricanter, which in one single
  step is able to separate the liquid into solids, stickwater and fish oil. 


  Oil can be further treated in a polisher for optimum quality.


  Evaporating of stickwater is optional but recommended to take out the last
  6-7% protein that is water soluble and thus valuable as they provide a better
  quality of the meal.


  The drier evaporates the water from the solids. The combination of gentle
  rotation and evaporations result in a fishmeal with approx. 10 % residual
  water.


  Vapour from the driers is drawn out and treated in a seawater scrubber
  together with ventilation air and vapour from the other process equipment.
  (optional)


  Warm and bony fish meal is conveyed to the hammer mill before cooling and
  transporting to meal silo as reservoir for bagging.  Transport may be by means
  of cooling screw conveyors or pneumatic system.

  Typical onboard fishmeal plants have a capacity range of between 150 to 250
  tons of raw materials per day.

  **Mass and Energy Balance** 


  All fishmeal plants are being calculated based on given numbers for rest raw
  material to be processed. This calculation are set up in a Mass and Energy
  Balance Scheme to specify dimensions on all equipment and piping. 


  **Flowsheet**


  After finalizing a M&E balance we produce a flowsheet and 3D drawing to
  optimize the tradeoff betwen size, quality in materials and cost. 


  **P&ID** 


  Together with client or yard, we produce all necessarry drawings and plan all
  interfaces for easy assembly and use. Of course PLC system are included - and
  can be integrated into the majority of common PLC systems (for global control)
