description1: >-
  Combining electrolysis and ultrasound in a single reactor provides
  unparalleled water treatment performance and efficiency for safe and effective
  electrochemical reagent generation on-site. The DB Series of reactors have
  wide-ranging treatment capabilities, simply by changing the electrode
  material.


  \* Small, robust and modular configuration allowing high flow volumes


  \* Compact design aimed at high viscosity liquids


  \* No liquid chemical or polymer required for coagulation and pH correction


  \* Highly dewatered sludge production


  \* Supplied as a factory-built, plug-and-play solution


  \* Easily installed alone, or retro-fitted to existing
  overloaded/underperforming plants


  \* Easy-change electrode plates


  \* Available with on-line parameter monitoring and control


  \* Includes adaptive control and remote access monitoring, control and
  automation

description2: "Soneco uses a low-carbon, low-voltage source of power to obtain the safe and controlled generation of water treatment reagents on-site.\r\n\n\rReactive water treatment reagents are metered precisely and directly into the process stream â€“ simply by varying the electric current that is applied to the electrodes, in a controlled and calculated manner. This novel, fast and controllable treatment system uses a state-of-the-art, in-house designed Power Control System (PSU) to ensure fine-control of the system and its ancillaries and ensuring high-efficiency and reliability."
