description1: "We design and manufacture meal cooler systems specially adopted for local requirements.\r\n\nIn FTGâ€™s home region of Northern Europe, there are normally enough cooling water and cold ambient air, which makes the process design pretty straight forward.\r\n\nHowever, in sensitive areas with restricted cooling water supply often combined with high ambient temperatures it can be challenging to meet local requirements for emissions to water and air, and for such applications we have developed a special indirectly cooled air hygienic air cooler system."

  The cooler is designed as a long drum equipped with an agitator mounted in
  roller bearings on the end plates. 


  Hot meal is stirred through the cooler, while we use a cetrifugal fan to draw
  a counterflow of cool air.
