  We design and manufacture meal cooler system specially adopted for the local
  requirements. 


  In our own region there are normally sufficient cooling water and cold ambient
  air, which makes this process design pretty straight forward.


  In sensitive areas with restricted cooling water supply and high ambient
  temperatures it can be challenging to meet local requirements for emissions to
  water and air, and for such applications we have developed a special
  indirectly cooled air hygienic air cooler system.

  The cooler is designed as along drum equipped with an agitator mounted in
  roller bearings on the end plates. 


  Hot meal is stirred through the cooler, while we use a cetrifugal fan to draw
  a counterflow of cool air.
