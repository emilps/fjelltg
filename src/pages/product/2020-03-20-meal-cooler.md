  To avoid condensation in dried fishmeal, it is important to have correct
  cooling - before storing it in tanks, sacks or bigbags.


  We offer solutions for every need - whether it is in warm regions (Asia) or on
  fishing boats designed for fishing in Arctic regions.


  In sensitive areas with restricted cooling water supply and high ambient
  temperatures it can be challenging to meet local requirements for emissions to
  water and air, and for such applications we have developed a special
  indirectly cooled air hygienic air cooler system.

  The cooler is designed as a long drum equipped with an agitator mounted in
  roller bearings on the end plates. 


  Hot meal is stirred through the cooler, while we use a centrifugal fan to draw
  a counterflow of cool air.
