  FTG can design and deliver fish meal plants for both land and marine use.


  Fish meal processing has traditionally consisted of the main steps:


  Coagulation, separation and evaporation/drying. The dominating process for
  half a century has been the Stord Fish Meal Process with the main steps:


  * Cooking in steam heated screw cooker,

  * Pressing in twin screw press and oil separation in centrifuges,

  * Evaporation of stick water in waste heat evaporator


  Drying of press cake and concentrate in disc drier and milling and cooling of
  meal


  The process requirements depend on the freshness of the catch, type of fish,
  requirements for meal and oil quality, cooling water quality, ambient
  temperatures and environmental issues.
