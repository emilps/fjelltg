description1: "FTG can design and deliver fish meal plants for both land and marine use.\n\nFish meal processing has traditionally consisted of the main steps:\r\n\n\rCoagulation, separation and evaporation/drying. The dominating process for half a century has been the Stord Fish Meal Process with the main steps:\r\n\n* \rCooking in steam heated screw cooker,\r\n* Pressing in twin screw press and oil separation in centrifuges,\r\n* \rEvaporation of stick water in waste heat evaporator\r\n* \rDrying of press cake and concentrate in disc drier and milling and cooling of meal\r\n\n\rThe process requirements depend on the freshness of the catch, type of fish, requirements for meal and oil quality, cooling water quality, ambient temperatures and environmental issues."
