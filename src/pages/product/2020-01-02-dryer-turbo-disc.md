  ## Design


  The Fjell Turbo Disc Dryer is designed for indirect heating by steam (6-10
  bar). The dryer can be delivered for vacuum drying of temperature sensitive
  raw materials. The largest heating surface is the rotor, but additional
  heating surface is available as an option on the stator. The product to be
  dried is slowly, but vigorously, transported from inlet to outlet end by a
  paddle system mounted on the disc periphery. 


  Product discharge is normally done continuously by a speed controlled
  extraction screw conveyor. The discs are mounted on a heavy central shaft with
  a highly efficient condensate removal system integrated. Scraper bars ensure
  agitation between the discs, which is necessary for an efficient evaporation.
  The moisture evaporated from the product is collected in a high top vapour
  dome, and continuously removed. 


  Dryers can be supplied in all practical sizes, in all common materials of
  construction (carbon-, stainless-, and duplex steels), and approved and
  inspected according to the leading international design codes and standards
  (PED, ASME, JIS, GOST, DNV, Lloyds, Bureau Veritas etc..) The dryer has a
  unique endurable patented rotor design without traditional welded stays
  exposed to tear, wear, fatigue and corrosion.

  ## Advantages


  * Forged claws can be welded with high precision in a flat position with the
  use of a robotwelder 

  * It can be performed both a visual and a penetrant test prior to assembly 

  * Welds are not exposed to external environment in dryer. Thereby risk for
  stress corrosion cracking is eliminated 

  * Welds do not seal between the pressurised and non-pressurised side. This
  eliminates the risk of steam leakage

  * Claws act as reinforcement beams in the radial direction, this increase the
  lateral bending strength of the discs, which reduces the risk of leakages in
  the foot welds between discs


  The distinct difference between the TD dryer and most other disc dryers is
  that staybolt welds (or welds of other means to maintain the integrity of the
  disc when exposed to internal steam pressure) is entirely on the inside of the
  disc. Fjell has in its process for drying with disc-driers a patented process
  solution reducing usage of steam with approx. 40% from normal driers.

  ## Legacy


  In the year 2000 Fjell Technology Group AS decided to develop a robust and
  energy efficient disc dryer specially designed for modern manufacturing
  methods like robotic welding. We had a competent staff with senior personnel
  having experience from design, manufacturing and installation of about 2000
  Stord dryers since the introduction of the technology, wich took place in the
  late 50ies. 


  We added some young innovative engineers skilled in state of the art
  engineering design and analysis techniques. The result was the Fjell Turbo
  Disc Dryer with a unique patented disc design, based on efficient
  manufacturing techniques.

  ## Application

  * Sludge in Waste Water 
  * Treatment Plant for fishmeal in both land based and ship installed plants 
  * Ingredients in the food industry
  * Spent grains in distilleries and breweries
  * Animal and poultry by-products for industrial bio-sludge and mineral sludge 
  * Replacement rotors and units for old disc dryers
