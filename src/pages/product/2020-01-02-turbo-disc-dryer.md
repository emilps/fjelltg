We had a competent staff with senior personnel having experience from design, manufacturing and installation of about 2000 Stord dryers since the introduction of the technology, wich took place in the late 50ies. \n\n\L\LWe added some young innovative engineers skilled in state of the art engineering design and analysis techniques. The result was the Fjell Turbo Disc Dryer with a unique patented disc design, based on efficient manufacturing techniques."
