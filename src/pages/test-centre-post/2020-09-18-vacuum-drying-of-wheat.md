  This week we conducted a successful test of wheat. The actual test drying was
  carried out at low temperature and with 300 mBar pressure (vacuum). This
  provides a gentle treatment of the material and preserves the various
  nutrients as much as possible. Afterwards, the end product is sent for
  analysis. Further testing will take place through the winter to find the
  optimal drying process
