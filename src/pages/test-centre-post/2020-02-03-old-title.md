  A large part of the experience we have in the FTG is related to the operation
  of various drying plants, and not least test trials on different types of
  substances. We have experience and data in a variety of different areas such
  as fish residuals for Human Grade flour and oil, pet food, other animal feed
  or fish feed, silage for animal feed and BIO diesel, seaweed for tare
  alginates, sludge for fertilizer, biogas, coal (pyrolysis), mask from
  breweries / distilleries, animal feed for chicken feed, maize residue for
  chicken feed and sugar beet process for ingredients for animal feed or ethane
  / methane / high-grade acids
