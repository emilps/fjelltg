  Evaporation plants are required whenever in a process, water or any other
  solvent has to be removed, concentration has to be increased or volume
  reduced. Fjell Technology Group may supply various types of evaporators. Each
  type offers its own benefit, and the most suitable type is selected in each
  case with consideration of the main process parameters, scaling tendency,
  product thermal sensitivity, annual operating hours and accessibility for
  maintenance.   FTG also design smart solutions for cleaning the evaporator.  

  To ensure a long life syclus, FTG evaporators are made of the most adequate
  materials of construction such as stainless steel, duplex steel and nickel
  alloys.  

  The Waste Heat Evaporator at Sanki is evaporating approximately 6% of soluble
  proteins from the stick water and increases the quality of the meal
  significantly. The evaporator is heated by the vapour from the dryers, so the
  energy is more or less at no cost.

      Fjell Technology Group was originally established almost 50 years ago as
      local manufacturer of evaporator stages and tube and shell heat exchangers
      for Stord Bartz, and produced many hundred stages until year 2000.  Since
      then we have designed, manufactured and commissioned many complete
      evaporator systems, both WHE, MVR and our unique Forced Flash Finisher.
