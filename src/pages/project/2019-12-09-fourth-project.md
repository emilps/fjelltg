  Through a former cooperating company, FTG was requested to design, engineer
  and install a  process solution to clense the waste water from their RAS
  facility. We engineered the Fjell Fishsludge Recovery System.

description1: >-
  FTG designed and engineered a solution based on three steps:

  1: Flocculation - with help from dedicated supplier within electro
  flocculation - capturing and thickening the dry solids from 0,5% to 5,5%

  2: Then sentrifuge the dry solids until a sludge of approx. 22%. 

  3: Dry the sludge with a thermo mechanical dryer to above 90%

description2: >
  The machinery can be installed at any land-based fish farming facility or
  wastewater plant. It can dry sludge from 0.1 per cent dry substance (ds) and
  up to 99 per cent ds.

  Fjellâ€™s dryer design is patented and market-leading, and for drying large
  volumes of sludge it is the most energy-efficient dryer available on the
  market.

  The dried sludge is repurposed as an additive for producing fertiliser, or in
  other agricultural products that rely on nutrients such as nitrogen and
  phosphorus.
