title: 2018 - ERKO Settefisk
description: |+
  Erko Settefisk was one of our first plants to clean sludge from RAS plants.

description1: >-
  At the beginning of such a project, it is important to get the correct data on
  the outgoing water volumes from the plant and not least the amount of feed.


  The amount of salt in the water is also of great importance - to be able to
  set up solutions for solutes as well as total suspended solids. Finally, it is
  the degree of cleaning that the customer needs, which then sets the conditions
  for the choice of equipment and the design.


  **FTG designed and engineered a solution based on three steps:**


  **1.** Flocculation - with help from dedicated supplier within electro
  flocculation -      capturing and thickening the dry solids from 0,5% to 5,5%


  **2.** Then sentrifuge the dry solids until a sludge of approx. 22%.


  **3.** Dry the sludge with a thermo mechanical dryer to above 90%.


  Since the commissioning period the sludge drying system has been running
  problem free - please [contact us](https://www.fjelltg.no/contact/) if any
  questions regarding setup, solutions or if we in any way can help you.

description2: >-
  The machinery can be installed at any land-based fish farming facility or
  wastewater plant. It can dry sludge from 0.1 per cent dry substance (ds) and
  up to 99 per cent ds.  

  Fjell’s dryer design is patented and market-leading, and for drying large
  volumes of sludge it is the most energy-efficient dryer available on the
  market.  

  The dried sludge is repurposed as an additive for producing fertiliser, or in
  other agricultural products that rely on nutrients such as nitrogen and
  phosphorus.

      Combining electrolysis and ultrasound in a single reactor provides
      unparalleled water treatment performance and efficiency for safe and
      effective electrochemical reagent generation on-site. The DB Series of
      reactors have wide-ranging treatment capabilities, simply by changing the
      electrode material.
    description2: "Soneco uses a low-carbon, low-voltage source of power to obtain the safe and controlled generation of water treatment reagents on-site.\r\n\n\rReactive water treatment reagents are metered precisely and directly into the process stream – simply by varying the electric current that is applied to the electrodes, in a controlled and calculated manner. This novel, fast and controllable treatment system uses a state-of-the-art, in-house designed Power Control System (PSU) to ensure fine-control of the system and its ancillaries and ensuring high-efficiency and reliability."

      Dewatering Decanters are continuously operating horizontal solid-wall bowl
      centrifuges for maximum dewatering requirements of municipal and
      industrial wastewater sludge. The frame is of open design with either
      gravity or pressure discharge of the clarified phase.

    description1: "The TMD process is patented and has shown excellent results on materials with sticky behaviour during drying. In the TMD the heat required for the evaporation is generated directly in the material by a high-speed rotor.\r Technolgy is owned by Thermtech AS\n\nFTG is the only supplier for TMD towards fish farmers (RAS - and flow-through plants) in Norway."
    description2: |-
      The TMD can be applied for the following areas:

      * Bio sludge
      * Municipal waste
      * Fish offal
      * Fish and animal manure
      * Organic products
      * Proteins
      * Blood

      Fjell RAS Sludge drying system is a fully automated system, with minimal
      need for supervision. Unlike most other sludge drying technologies, Fjell
      RAS Sludge Dryers do not require the addition of polymer (plastic), or
      other additives. This provides an environmentally friendly end product
      (fertilizer), while drying is more cost effective.
