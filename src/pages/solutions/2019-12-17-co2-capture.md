  Fjell Technology Group can provide experienced project management and project
  resources for consultation, facilitation or development of different
  technologies within the greentech area.

  In 2007, Statoil took initiative for a Development process aming for a CO2
  capturing process compact and lightweight enough for an offshore installment.
  Fjell Technology Group is now, on behalf of an initiative coowned by Amtech
  and CMR Prototech, heading a Equinor (former Statoil) and Climit-funded
  Project for developing and commercializing the Technology.


  Keeping the capturing installment small and light-weighted, the Technology is
  also very well suited for Onshore based industry. The capturing units are
  modulated scalable, which provides more flexibility and significantly lower
  Capex than traditional Amine-based CO2 capturing. It will also be able to make
  capturing of CO2 at smaller emission points, even marine installations,
  commercially interresting.


  The project team consists of researchers and developers from Tel-Tek (now part
  of Sintef), CMR Prototech, Equinor and Fjell Technology Group. Visit the
  Product site to read more about the 3C Technology.




  The 3C technology captures CO₂ at a lower cost and in a more
  environment-friendly way than conventional methods. Installing the technology
  will lead to immediate reductions in carbon emissions.


  The technology aims to reduce capital expenditure by 50 per cent without
  losing capacity or efficiency. It also lowers operating expenses compared to
  conventional capture plants.


  The 3C technology can be installed on most of the existing sources of carbon
  emissions. Globally, the emissions catchable with carbon capture and storage
  technology exceeds 10 billion metric tons per year.


  The 3C technology was invented in collaboration with Fjell Technology Group,
  Equinor, CMR Prototech and SINTEF. The development project was initiated by
  Equinor in 2007, while the first patent for the technology was granted in
  1999. The project is funded by Climit, the Norwegian governmental financing
  initiative for carbon capture and storage.


  2008-2014: The 3C technology was developed as a project under Equinor’s
  management.


  2015: Fjell Technology Group is given the role as project lead. Several
  project phases were launched under Climit and Equinor support.


  2018: The company Compact Carbon Capture AS was established, and all the IP
  and know-how was transferred from Equinor and Fjell Technology Group
  management periods to Compact Carbon Capture.


  2019: The development continued  in collaboration with all the partners
  Equinor, Fjell Technology Group, Sintef and CMR Prototech. The technology were
  now at a “10 tonne per day Pilot”-stage, and continued towards a market ready
  technology.


  2020: Several exciting things are waiting to happen, and interesting news are
  on the steps, including onboarding of several new partners.


  Currently we are heading three projects for capturing CO2.


  First project (now seperated as a single purpose company) is within the
  3C-area, using amine as sorbent. Our main goal is to reduce size and weight
  compared to traditional carbon capture Technology. The other two use Carbonate
  looping, featuring state of the art Nano-Technology.

  In 2016, Fjell Technology Group started a Climit-founded a Project initiated
  by Our Research partners NTNU and Sintef. In 2017, there was started another
  Project within the same Group. The projects aim to develop  solid sorbent
  technologies to capture co2 with a significantly lower energy penalty than a
  corresponding process using amine.
description3: "Fjell Technology Group is, in collaboration with SINTEF and NTNU in addition to the MBCL technology, developing several methods for H2 (Hydrogen) production.\r\n\n\rThe technologies are Carbon neutral, either through capturing CO2 when producing H2 from Methane, or producing H2 from already carbon neutral material. Both technologies can deliver Hydrogen as a non-emitting CO2 source of energy, and the aim is to reduce parasittic use of energy compared to electrolysis.\r\n\n\rThe technology is developed as a project delivery for Amtech AS and will later on be commercialized as a single purpose company."
