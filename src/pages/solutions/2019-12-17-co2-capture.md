  Fjell Technology Group can provide experienced project management and project
  resources for consultation, facilitation or development of different
  technologies within the greentech area.
description1: "In 2007, Statoil took initiative for a Development process aming for a CO2 capturing process compact and lightweight enough for an offshore installment. Fjell Technology Group is now, on behalf of an initiative coowned by Amtech and CMR Prototech, heading a Equinor (former Statoil) and Climit-funded Project for developing and commercializing the Technology.\r\n\n\r\n\nKeeping the capturing installment small and light-weighted, the Technology is also very well suited for Onshore based industry. The capturing units are modulated scalable, which provides more flexibility and significantly lower Capex than traditional Amine-based CO2 capturing. It will also be able to make capturing of CO2 at smaller emission points, even marine installations, commercially interresting.\r\n\n\r\n\nThe project team consists of researchers and developers from Tel-Tek (now part of Sintef), CMR Prototech, Equinor and Fjell Technology Group. Visit the Product site to read more about the 3C Technology."

  In 2016, Fjell Technology Group started a Climit-founded a Project initiated
  by Our Research partners NTNU and Sintef. In 2017, there was started another
  Project within the same Group. The projects aim to develop  solid sorbent
  technologies to capture co2 with a significantly lower energy penalty than a
  corresponding process using amine.
description3: "Fjell Technology Group is, in collaboration with SINTEF and NTNU in addition to the MBCL technology, developing several methods for H2 (Hydrogen) production.\r\n\n\rThe technologies are Carbon neutral, either through capturing CO2 when producing H2 from Methane, or producing H2 from already carbon neutral material. Both technologies can deliver Hydrogen as a non-emitting CO2 source of energy, and the aim is to reduce parasittic use of energy compared to electrolysis.\r\n\n\rThe technology is developed as a project delivery for Amtech AS and will later on be commercialized as a single purpose company."
