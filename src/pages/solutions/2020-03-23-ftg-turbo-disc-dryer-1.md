  The Fjell Turbo Disc Dryer is designed for indirect heating by steam (6-10
  bar). The largest heating surface is the rotor, but additional heating surface
  is available as an option on the stator. The product to be dried is slowly but
  vigorously, transported from inlet to outlet end by a paddle system mounted on
  the disc periphery. 


  Product discharge is normally done continuously by a speed controlled
  extraction screw conveyor. The discs are mounted on a heavy central shaft with
  a highly efficient condensate removal system integrated. Scraper bars ensure
  agitation between the discs, which is necessary for an efficient evaporation.
  The moisture evaporated from the product is collected in a high top vapour
  dome, and continuously removed. 


  Dryers can be supplied in all practical sizes, in all common materials of
  construction (carbon-, stainless-, and duplex steels), and approved and
  inspected according to the leading international design codes and standards
  (PED, ASME, JIS, GOST, DNV, Lloyds, Bureau Veritas etc..) The dryer has a
  unique endurable patented rotor design without traditional welded stays
  exposed to tear, wear, fatigue and corrosion.


  The distinct difference between the TD dryer and most other disc dryers is
  that staybolt welds (or welds of other means to maintain the integrity of the
  disc when exposed to internal steam pressure) is entirely on the inside of the
  disc. Fjell has in its process for drying with disc-driers a patented process
  solution reducing usage of steam with approx. 40% from normal driers.

  Advantages between Fjell TD Dryer vs. other Rotadisc dryers:


  * Forged claws can be welded with high precision in flat position using
  robots. 

  * Welds can be inspected with NDT before assembly. 

  * Welds are not exposed to the material to be dried, thereby risk for stress
  corrosion cracking is eliminated. 

  * Welds do not seal between pressurised and non-pressurised side. Thereby risk
  for steam leakage is eliminated. 

  * Claws act as reinforcement beams in radial direction, thereby increasing the
  lateral bending strength of the discs, which reduces the risk for leakages in
  foot welds between discs (big problem with Rotadisc). 

  * Smooth disc surface secures efficient self-cleaning and maximum heat
  transfer.
