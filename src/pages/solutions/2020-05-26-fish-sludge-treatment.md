  municipal wastewater plants.

  The sludge is used as an additive in fertiliser or other agricultural
  products.

  **Fjell Technology Group has a unique combination of long experience and high
  competence**, and is a leader in research and development in the industry. We
  can supply equipment in full range from hatcheries, to smolt farms , to
  post-smolt farms,  to land-based ongrowing fish plants and semi-closed and
  closed ongrowing fish farms in the sea.


  We use **award-winning technology** without the use of chemical polymer for
  the purification stage of waste water from drum filter and biofilters (electro
  coagulation). We dewater and dry the wastewater sludge from the purification
  stage with tested and reliable in-house technology and from collaboration
  partnes. The TMD dryer is our standard processing equipment for drying,
  sanitising and stabilizing the sludge. Fish sludge is extremely difficult to
  dry efficaciously due to variations in fatty acids composition and a
  troublesome glue phase. the TMD dryer handles these obstacles without any
  problems.

  The FTG Fishsludge Recovery System (FRS) system can dry sludge from 0.1 per
  cent Dry Matter (DM) and up to 99 per cent DM.

  Fish sludge is very demanding to dry but the TMD mill is specifically adapted
  to this challenging, fiberless material and its high fat content. Particularly
  the glue phase can be a problem, however the patented TMD mill is robust and
  resistant. System is also not sensitive to plant load (altered biomass), or
  changes in composition.


  The dried sludge is repurposed as an additive for producing fertilizer, or in
  other agricultural products that rely on nutrients such as nitrogen and
  phosphorus. **Fjell's technology contributes to a circular economy by
  recycling heavy metals and nutrients from sludge and wastewater.**
description3: >-
  The solution helps fish farmers and municipal waste plants minimize the need
  for waste management and transport, which cuts both costs and emissions from
  production and treatment processes.


  The plant requires minimal maintenance and supervision and delivers stable and
  hygienized sludge.


  TMD is offered with Thermtech (technology owner) and partner - electro
  flocculation is offered with Power & Water as partner.
