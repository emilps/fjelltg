description1: "**Fjell Technology Group has a unique combination of long experience and high competence**, and is a leader in research and development in the industry. We can supply equipment in full range from hatcheries, to smolt farms , to post-smolt farms,  to land-based ongrowing fish plants and semi-closed and closed ongrowing fish farms in the sea.\n\nFjell Technology Group offer 3 main types of solutions for treatment of aquaculture wastewater: \n\n1. **Fjell P&W ECO Capture System: environmentally friendly solution with high capture rate.**\n\n**Award-winning technology** without the use of chemicals or polymer for structuring the wastewater. Combined with the best separation and dewatering technology in the market.\n\n{\"widget\":\"imageblock\",\"image\":\"/img/om2.jpg\"}\n\n2. **High Capture Separation System: highest possible capture rate**\n\nComplete automated system for structuring the wastewater, separation (thickening) and dewatering with capture rate as high as 90-95%. Brings wastewater with dry matter content (DM) of about 0,1%DM up to above 20% DM. \n\n![](/img/5-trinns-separasjonssystem.png \"5-step High Capture Separation System\")\n\n\r\n\n\\- Low-Cost Capture System: low investment cost and moderate capture rate\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nCombining well proved technology of bandfilters and decanter sentrifuges. This system offers high hydraulic treatment capacity combined with acceptable capture rate, and low investment costs.\n\n{\"widget\":\"imageblock\",\"text\":\"Fjell Low Cost Capture System\",\"image\":\"/img/render-sf-116540-01.jpg\"}\n\n \n\nAll the above wastewater treatment solutions can be combined with Fjell Technology's complete range of Sludge Dryer Systems. All solutions are scalable in the full range from small smolt farms up to large ongrowing fish farms. \n\n{\"widget\":\"imageblock\",\"text\":\"Fjell TMD Sludge Dryer System\",\"image\":\"/img/frs-.jpg\"}"

  The FTG Fishsludge Recycling System (FRS) system can treat wastewater with DM
  below 0,1% (1000 mg/liter) and through steps of wastewater structuring,
  thickening, dewatering and drying convert it to dry fine-corned stabilised
  slugde.

  Fish sludge is very demanding to dry but the TMD hammer mill is specifically
  adapted to this challenging, fiberless material and its high fat content.
  Particularly the glue phase can be a problem, however the patented TMD mill is
  robust and resistant. 


  The dried sludge is repurposed as an additive for producing fertilizer, or in
  other agricultural products that rely on nutrients such as nitrogen and
  phosphorus. **Fjell's technology contributes to a circular economy by
  recycling heavy metals and nutrients from sludge and wastewater.**
description3: >-
  The solution helps fish farmers and municipal waste plants minimize the need
  for waste management and transport, which cuts both costs and emissions from
  production and treatment processes.


  The plant requires little maintenance and supervision and delivers stable and
  hygienized sludge.


  TMD is offered together with Thermtech as partner.


  The Fjell P&W ECO Capture System is offered together with Power & Water and as
  partner.


  The High Capture Separation System if offered toogether with AL-2 as partner.


  The Low Cost Capture System is offered together with Trojan Technologies and
  GEA as partners.
