  Fjell designs several versions of singlestage screw cooker and double stage
  screw cooker
description1: >-
  A Fjell boiler included in the plant provides opportunities for the most
  energy-efficient heating as in our process solutions we reuse heat between the
  various process steps.


  Typically first stage uses waste heat and second stage low pressure steam.


  The two stage solutions give better process control and increase the oil yield
  from marine and animal raw material. Our cookers are manufactured with a steam
  heated (up to 10 barge) rotor with multiple discs. Indirect heat is gently
  applied to the residual giving full coagulation control and efficiency.

  Our disc cooker is the best solution for process control and increase oil
  yield from marine and animal raw material.

  We deliver all the classic sizes of Stord SS type cookers from small units for
  a few MT raw material per hour to the large SS160/14 rated for 30 MT per hour.

  For new installations, we recommend our special two stage screw cooker system
  with improved process control and more sensitive energy usage. 


  This cooker system has proven to reduce stick water, suspended solids content,
  give better process control and increase the oil yield from marine and animal
  raw material.

      ## Design


      The Fjell Turbo Disc Dryer is designed for indirect heating by steam (6-10
      bar). The dryer can be delivered for vacuum drying of temperature
      sensitive raw materials. The largest heating surface is the rotor, but
      additional heating surface is available as an option on the stator. The
      product to be dried is slowly, but vigorously, transported from inlet to
      outlet end by a paddle system mounted on the disc periphery. 


      Product discharge is normally done continuously by a speed controlled
      extraction screw conveyor. The discs are mounted on a heavy central shaft
      with a highly efficient condensate removal system integrated. Scraper bars
      ensure agitation between the discs, which is necessary for an efficient
      evaporation. The moisture evaporated from the product is collected in a
      high top vapour dome, and continuously removed. 


      Dryers can be supplied in all practical sizes, in all common materials of
      construction (carbon-, stainless-, and duplex steels), and approved and
      inspected according to the leading international design codes and
      standards (PED, ASME, JIS, GOST, DNV, Lloyds, Bureau Veritas etc..) The
      dryer has a unique endurable patented rotor design without traditional
      welded stays exposed to tear, wear, fatigue and corrosion.

      ## Legacy


      In the year 2000 Fjell Technology Group AS decided to develop a robust and
      energy efficient disc dryer specially designed for modern manufacturing
      methods like robotic welding. We had a competent staff with senior
      personnel having experience from design, manufacturing and installation of
      about 2000 Stord dryers since the introduction of the technology, wich
      took place in the late 50ies. 


      We added some young innovative engineers skilled in state of the art
      engineering design and analysis techniques. The result was the Fjell Turbo
      Disc Dryer with a unique patented disc design, based on efficient
      manufacturing techniques.

      ## Advantages


      Advantages between Fjell TD Dryer vs. other Rotadisc dryers:


      * Forged claws can be welded with high precision in flat position using
      robots. 

      * Welds can be inspected with NDT before assembly. 

      * Welds are not exposed to the material to be dried, thereby risk for
      stress corrosion cracking is eliminated. 

      * Welds do not seal between pressurised and non-pressurised side. Thereby
      risk for steam leakage is eliminated. 

      * Claws act as reinforcement beams in radial direction, thereby increasing
      the lateral bending strength of the discs, which reduces the risk for
      leakages in foot welds between discs (big problem with Rotadisc). 

      * Smooth disc surface secures efficient self-cleaning and maximum heat
      transfer.


      The distinct difference between the TD dryer and most other disc dryers is
      that staybolt welds (or welds of other means to maintain the integrity of
      the disc when exposed to internal steam pressure) is entirely on the
      inside of the disc. Fjell has in its process for drying with disc-driers a
      patented process solution reducing usage of steam with approx. 40% from
      normal driers.

      ## Application


      * Sludge in Waste Water 

      * Treatment Plant for fishmeal in both land based and ship installed
      plants 

      * Ingredients in the food industry

      * Spent grains in distilleries and breweries

      * Animal and poultry by-products for industrial bio-sludge and mineral
      sludge 

      * Replacement rotors and units for old disc dryers

      Fjell Technology Group was originally established almost 50 years ago as
      local manufacturer of evaporator stages and tube and shell heat exchangers
      for Stord Bartz, and produced many hundred stages until year 2000.  Since
      then we have designed, manufactured and commissioned many complete
      evaporator systems, both WHE, MVR and our unique Forced Flash Finisher.
