  The Fjell Turbo Disc Dryer is designed for indirect heating by steam (6-10
  bar). The dryer can be delivered for vacuum drying of temperature sensitive
  raw materials. The largest heating surface is the rotor, but additional
  heating surface is available as an option on the stator. The product to be
  dried is slowly, but vigorously, transported from inlet to outlet end by a
  paddle system mounted on the disc periphery. 


  Product discharge is normally done continuously by a speed controlled
  extraction screw conveyor. The discs are mounted on a heavy central shaft with
  a highly efficient condensate removal system integrated. Scraper bars ensure
  agitation between the discs, which is necessary for an efficient evaporation.
  The moisture evaporated from the product is collected in a high top vapour
  dome, and continuously removed. 


  Dryers can be supplied in all practical sizes, in all common materials of
  construction (carbon-, stainless-, and duplex steels), and approved and
  inspected according to the leading international design codes and standards
  (PED, ASME, JIS, GOST, DNV, Lloyds, Bureau Veritas etc..) The dryer has a
  unique endurable patented rotor design without traditional welded stays
  exposed to tear, wear, fatigue and corrosion.

  Advantages between Fjell TD Dryer vs. other Rotadisc dryers:


  * Forged claws can be welded with high precision in flat position using
  robots. 

  * Welds can be inspected with NDT before assembly. 

  * Welds are not exposed to the material to be dried, thereby risk for stress
  corrosion cracking is eliminated. 

  * Welds do not seal between pressurised and non-pressurised side. Thereby risk
  for steam leakage is eliminated. 

  * Claws act as reinforcement beams in radial direction, thereby increasing the
  lateral bending strength of the discs, which reduces the risk for leakages in
  foot welds between discs (big problem with Rotadisc). 

  * Smooth disc surface secures efficient self-cleaning and maximum heat
  transfer.


  The distinct difference between the TD dryer and most other disc dryers is
  that staybolt welds (or welds of other means to maintain the integrity of the
  disc when exposed to internal steam pressure) is entirely on the inside of the
  disc. Fjell has in its process for drying with disc-driers a patented process
  solution reducing usage of steam with approx. 40% from normal driers.

      We design and manufacture meal cooler system specially adopted for the
      local requirements. 


      In our own region there are normally sufficient cooling water and cold
      ambient air, which makes this process design pretty straight forward.


      In sensitive areas with restricted cooling water supply and high ambient
      temperatures it can be challenging to meet local requirements for
      emissions to water and air, and for such applications we have developed a
      special indirectly cooled air hygienic air cooler system.
    description2: >-
      To avoid condenstation meal should be cooled to approx. 15 degrees above
      ambient temperatures


      Low costs for installation and maintanance

    infobox1: >-
      The cooler is designed as a long drum equipped with an agitator mounted in
      roller bearings on the end plates. 


      Hot meal is stirred through the cooler, while we use a cetrifugal fan to
      draw a counterflow of cool air.

      ## Design


      Fjell designs several versions:


      Singlestage screw cooker


      Double stage screw cooker


      Typically first stage uses waste heat and second stage low pressure steam.


      The two stage solutions give better process control and increase the oil
      yield from marine and animal raw material.


      Our disc cooker is the best solution for process control and increase oil
      yield from marine and animal raw material. 


      Our cookers are manufactured with a steam heated (up to 10 barge) rotor
      with multiple discs. Indirect heat is gently applied to the residual
      giving full coagulation control and efficiency.


      We deliver all the classic sizes of Stord SS type cookers from small units
      for a few MT raw material per hour to the large SS160/14 rated for 30 MT
      per hour. 


      For new installations, we recommend our special two stage screw cooker
      system with improved process control and more sensitive energy usage. 


      This cooker system has proven to reduce stick water, suspended solids
      content, give better process control and increase the oil yield from
      marine and animal raw material.
    description2: "## Legacy\n\nIn the year 2000 Fjell Technology Group AS decided to develop a robust and energy efficient rotor desgin specially designed for modern manufacturing methods like robotic welding. We had a competent staff with senior personnel having experience from design, manufacturing and installation of about 2000 Stord dryers since the introduction of the technology, wich took place in the late 50ies. \n\n\L\LWe added some young innovative engineers skilled in state of the art engineering design and analysis techniques. The result was the Fjell Turbo Disc Dryer with a unique patented disc design, based on efficient manufacturing techniques."

      Fjell Technology Group was originally established almost 50 years ago as
      local manufacturer of evaporator stages and tube and shell heat exchangers
      for Stord Bartz, and produced many hundred stages until year 2000.  Since
      then we have designed, manufactured and commissioned many complete
      evaporator systems, both WHE, MVR and our unique Forced Flash Finisher.
