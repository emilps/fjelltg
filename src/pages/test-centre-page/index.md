  Due to 40 years of experience of drying multiple sorts of bio rest, fish
  waste, municipal sludge, poultry residuals, kelp and waste from rafineries,
  destilleries and breweries - we have gained knowledge on which technology is
  more likely to be preferred when trying to succeed on drying new substances.
  FTG has facilities for testing on different types of technology or can
  facilitate testing with cooperate partners and universities.
