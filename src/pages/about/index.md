### History

Fjell were established in 2000 and are based on more than 40 years of experience in high-end engineering and fabrication work from the process industry on and offshore. In 2012 FTG conducted a strategic decision towards becoming a leading supplier for Greentech. Workshop operations and some of the engineering capacity were demerged into their own companies and sold. FTG retained key personnel, patents, all the knowhow and production facilities.

## Strategy

FTG has a strategy of having a high level of expertise in engineering and project management.

Through incremental improvement, as well as occasionally radical solutions, the products in 2020 have a top-of-the-range standard. This applies to both material improvements and technical design – so that energy efficiency and lifetime are optimized.

The vision is operationalized through a program for continuous improvement. Before the work is started, an understanding of specified delivery is ensured. Task and risk are defined, while at the same time setting an agreed plan for progress, requirements and expectations. Not least risk is defined in connection with execution. In order to ensure delivery, management follows closely on various KPIs, as well as learning after completion. Process descriptions and plans is key to ensure a delivery better than expectations.

FTGs R&D-department also contributes in great extent to research regarding CO2 capture and other projects within Greentech.
