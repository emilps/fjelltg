## Strategy

FTG has a strategy of having a high level of expertise in engineering and project management. The purpose is to be able to offer R&D for customers and partners, when customers do not have the necessary knowledge.  At the same time, FTG wants to be able to carry out project follow-up and deliveries, in order to offer comprehensive solutions.

Through incremental improvement, as well as occasionally radical solutions, the products in 2019 have a top-of-the-range standard. This applies to both material improvements and technical design – so that energy efficiency and lifetime are optimized.

The vision is operationalized through a program for continuous improvement. Before the work is started, an understanding of specified delivery is ensured. Task and risk are defined, while at the same time setting an agreed plan for progress, requirements and expectations. Not least risk is defined in connection with execution. In order to ensure delivery, management follows closely on various KPIs, as well as learning after completion. Process descriptions and plans is key to ensure a delivery better than expectations.

FTGs R&D-department also contributes in great extent to research regarding CO2 capture and other projects within Greentech.
