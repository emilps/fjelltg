texttitle: Introduction
information: "Fjell Technology Group recycles sludge from aquaculture facilities and municipal wastewater plants. The sludge is used as an additive in fertiliser or other agricultural products. \r\n\nLand-based fish farming is an expanding industry, which will continue to grow in the coming years. With more fish farms being established on land, however, waste management becomes an increasing concern. \r\n\nThe land-based farms must dispose of fish sludge consisting mainly of uneaten fish feed and faeces. Fish sludge contains heavy metals such as zinc, nickel and cadmium, but also nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. \r\n\nWaste is also an ongoing concern for many municipalities and waste management authorities, who have to manage public sewage and waste streams for growing populations. \r\n\n\n\n**Recycling sludge as fertiliser**\r\n\nFjell Technology Group has created technology for drying fish sludge and other types of wastewater and separating its contents for reuse. \rThis process is branded as Fjell Fishsludge Recovery System (FRS). \n\nThe machinery can be installed at any land-based fish farming facility or wastewater plant. It can dry sludge from 0.1 per cent dry substance (ds) and up to 99 per cent ds.\r\n\nFjell’s dryer design is patented and market-leading, and for drying large volumes of sludge it is the most energy-efficient dryer available on the market.\r\n\nThe dried sludge is repurposed as an additive for producing fertiliser, or in other agricultural products that rely on nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus.\r\n\n\r**Concrete benefits**\r\n\nFjell’s technology contributes to a circular economy by recycling heavy metals and nutrients from sludge and wastewater.\r\n\nThe solution helps fish farmers and municipal waste plants to minimise the need for waste management and transport, which cuts both costs and emissions from production and treatment processes.\r\n\nFTG has delivered its biowaste handling equipment worldwide, including to Germany, Iceland, Italy, Japan, Norway and Saudi Arabia.\r\n\n\r\n\nAt  a glance\r\n\n\\-\tRecycling of fish sludge and wastewater for fertiliser\r\n\n\\-\tDries waste by up to 99%\r\n\n\\-\tReduces the need for waste transport \r\n\n\r\n\nPlease check our references for more info."
