subtitle: We are converting sludge into a valuable resource
texttitle: Introduction
information: "Fjell Technology Group recycles sludge from fishfarms and municipal waste water plants. The sludge is used as an additive in fertiliser or other agricultural products. \n\n**Land-based fish farming** is an expanding industry, which will continue to grow in the coming years. With more fish farms being established on land, however, waste management becomes an increasing concern. \n\nThe land-based farms must dispose of fish sludge consisting mainly of uneaten fish feed and faeces. \n\nThe machinery can be installed at any land-based fish farming facility or wastewater plant. The system purify the wastewater without the need for using chemical polymer, dewater the sludge,  and dry the sludge from 0.1 per cent Dry Matter (DM) and up to 99 per cent DM. This process is branded as Fjell Fishsludge Recovery System (FRS). \n\n**Waste water** is also an ongoing concern for many municipalities and waste management authorities, who have to manage public sewage and waste streams for growing populations. \n\nFjell’s dryer design is patented and market-leading, and for drying large volumes of sludge it is the most energy-efficient dryer available on the market.\n\nThe dried sludge is repurposed as an additive for producing fertiliser, or in other agricultural products that rely on nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus.\n\n**Concrete benefits**\n\nFjell’s technology contributes to a circular economy by recycling sludge to fertilizer.\n\nThe solution helps fish farmers and municipal waste plants to minimise the need for waste management and transport, which cuts both costs and emissions from production and treatment processes.\n\nFTG has delivered its biowaste handling equipment worldwide, including to Germany, Iceland, Italy, Japan, Norway and Saudi Arabia.\n\nAt  a glance\n\n\\-      Purifies the wastewater without the use of chemical polymer, high capture rate.  \n\n\\-\tRecycling of fish sludge and wastewater for fertiliser\n\n\\-\tDries waste water up to 99%\n\n\\-\tReduces the need for sludge transport \n\nPlease check our references for more info."
