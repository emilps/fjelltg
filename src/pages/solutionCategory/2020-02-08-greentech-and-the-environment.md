title: 'Waste Water Treatment '
subtitle: Converting sludge into a valuable resource
texttitle: Introduction
information: "Fjell Technology Group recycles sludge from fish farms and municipal waste water plants. The sludge is used as an additive in fertiliser or other agricultural products. \n\n**Land-based fish farming** and closed- & semi-closed fish farming cages in sea is an expanding industry, which will continue to grow in the coming years. With more fish farms of this type being established, wastewater management becomes an increasing concern. \n\nThese fish farms must clean their wastewater before letting it out into the recipient. The origin of the organic material in the wastewater is faeces and feed residues. The fish farms are obliged to remove organic material from the wastewater before they let it out into the surrounding sea. The reason for this is that a heavy organic load in the wastewater could cause algae blooms and oxygen depletion in the sea surrounding the fish farm. There are no dangerous materials in the wastewater. In a good seawater location with stong oceancurrent the waste water will be natural building blocks for new life in the sea. The problem is when too much organic load is accumulated in a concentrated area. \n\nIf we focus upon a land based farm there are typically two sources of wastewater that needs to be treated, The first and primary are meachanical filters of type disk filters or drum filters. All water circulating in a Recirculating Aquaculture System (RAS) or Flow Through fish farm goes through these mechanical filters. The suspended solids are collected by filters and through a backwash system removed from the filters at a regularity depending upon the amount of organic material in the water flowing through. The second source, fixed bed biofilters, are only relevant for RAS fish farms. These bioreactors convert ammonia (NH3) and ammonium (NH4+) to NO3- (Nitrate) by use of nitrifying bacteria living on fixed structures with large surface. These are complex and sensetive processes designed to make the water reusable for the fish, so that the fish farm can farm large biomasses of fish even at places with limited new water sources. \n\n\n\nThe machinery can be installed at any land-based fish farming facility or wastewater plant. The system purifies the wastewater without using chemical polymer, dewaters the sludge,  and dries the sludge from 0.1 per cent Dry Matter (DM) and up to 99 per cent DM. This process is branded as Fjell Fishsludge Recovery System (FRS). \n\n**Waste water** is also an ongoing concern for many municipalities and waste management authorities, who have to manage public sewage and waste streams for growing populations. \n\nFjell’s dryer design is patented and market-leading. For drying large volumes of sludge it is the most energy-efficient dryer available on the market.\n\nThe dried sludge is repurposed as an additive for producing fertiliser, or in other agricultural products that rely on nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus.\n\n**Concrete benefits**\n\nFjell’s technology contributes to a circular economy by recycling sludge to fertilizer.\n\nThe solution helps fish farmers and municipal waste plants to minimise the need for waste management and transport, which cuts both costs and emissions from production and treatment processes.\n\nFTG has delivered its biowaste handling equipment worldwide, including Germany, Iceland, Italy, Japan, Norway and Saudi Arabia.\n\nAt  a glance\n\n**\\-      Purifies the wastewater without the use of chemical polymer, high capture rate.**  \n\n**\\-\tRecycling of fish sludge and wastewater for fertiliser**\n\n**\\-\tDries waste water up to 99%**\n\n**\\-\tReduces the need for sludge transport** \n\nPlease check our references for more info."
