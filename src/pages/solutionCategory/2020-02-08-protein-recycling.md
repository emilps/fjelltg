texttitle: Introduction
information: >-
  The indirectly steam heated rotadisc (TST) dryer is invented by Peder Solheim
  from Leirvik at the island Stord, Norway in 1955. The dryer was introduced in
  the fish meal marked in the late 50ies by Stord Bartz, and quickly became a
  “must” for factories worldwide due to superior energy efficiency, safety,
  reliability and low odour emissions. The dryer technology, the twin screw
  press technology and the evaporator technology secured Stord Bartz enormous
  revenues in these early years. In the year 2000 the original workshop at Stord
  was closed down and all manufacturing of dryers was moved to Denmark and
  Poland.


  Fjell Technology Group, is a former supplier to Stord Bartz / Atlas-Stord. In
  the year 2000 we hired a group of key-personnel from Atlas-Stord with
  altogether 150 years of experience from market, process design and machine
  design to develop a new generation Disc Dryers named Fjell Turbo Disc Dryer.
  The dryer has a unique endurable patented rotor design without traditional
  welding, which stays exposed to tear, wear, fatigue and corrosion. The smooth
  outer disc surface with no high stressed welds is the best way to secure a
  long and troublefree dryer operation without being haunted by regular steam
  leakages,  which is a common experience for many plants. The Fjell Turbo Disc
  Dryer is our main product for Protein Recycling, and many processes are
  designed around this machine.
