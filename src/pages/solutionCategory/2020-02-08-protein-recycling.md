texttitle: Introduction
information: >-
  **Today:** FTG is the leading player in delivering energy-optimized plants on
  fishmeal and MWWT plants. We have unique R&D expertise and more than 40 years
  of experience. Our process solutions are engineered by market-leading
  expertise, with patented drying technology to optimize the consumption and
  flow.


  FTG has a vision on reducing CO2 footprint and energy consumption on fishmeal
  and oil plants by up to 50% by 2022.


  Fjell Technology Group already has several new patent-pending process
  optimizations, and our ambition is to establish a new quality standard for
  parchment flour and oil over the next few years.


  **Background:** The indirect steam heated rotadisc dryer is invented by Peder
  Solheim from Leirvik at the island Stord, Norway in 1955. The dryer was
  introduced in the fish meal market in the late 50ties by Stord Bartz, and
  quickly became a “must” for factories worldwide due to superior energy
  efficiency, safety, reliability and low odour emissions. 


  Fjell Technology Group, is a former supplier to Stord Bartz / Atlas-Stord. In
  the year 2000 we hired a group of key-personnel from Atlas-Stord with
  altogether 150 years of experience from market, process design and machine
  design to develop a new generation of Disc Dryers named Fjell Turbo Disc Dryer
  (TD dryer). 


  The dryer has a unique endurable patented rotor design without traditional
  welding, which stays exposed to tear, wear, fatigue and corrosion. The smooth
  outer disc surface with no high stressed welds is the best way to secure a
  long and troublefree dryer operation without being haunted by regular steam
  leakages,  which is a common experience for many plants. 


  The Fjell Turbo Disc Dryer is our main product for Protein Recycling, and many
  processes are designed around this dryer.
