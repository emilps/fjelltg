title: Compact Carbon Capture
subtitle: A joint mission to develop a sustainable solution to capture CO2
texttitle: Introduction
information: "The 3C technology captures CO₂ at a lower cost and in a more environment-friendly way than conventional methods. Installing the technology will lead to immediate reductions in carbon emissions.\r\n\n\rThe technology aims to reduce capital expenditure by 50 per cent without losing capacity or efficiency. It also lowers operating expenses compared to conventional capture plants.\r\n\nThe 3C technology can be installed on most of the existing sources of carbon emissions. Globally, the emissions catchable with carbon capture and storage technology exceeds 10 billion metric tons per year.\r\n\n\rThe 3C technology was invented in collaboration with Fjell Technology Group, Equinor, CMR Prototech and SINTEF. The development project was initiated by Equinor in 2007, while the first patent for the technology was granted in 1999. The project is funded by Climit, the Norwegian governmental financing initiative for carbon capture and storage.\r\n\n\r\n\n2008-2014: The 3C technology was developed as a project under Equinor’s management.\r\n\n\r2015: Fjell Technology Group is given the role as project lead. Several project phases were launched under Climit and Equinor support.\r\n\n\r2018: The company Compact Carbon Capture AS was established, and all the IP and know-how was transferred from Equinor and Fjell Technology Group management periods to Compact Carbon Capture.\r\n\n\r2019: The development continued  in collaboration with all the partners Equinor, Fjell Technology Group, Sintef and CMR Prototech. The technology were now at a “10 tonne per day Pilot”-stage, and continued towards a market ready technology.\r\n\n\r2020: Several exciting things are waiting to happen, and interesting news are on the steps, including onboarding of several new partners."
