title: Compact Carbon Capture
subtitle: A joint mission to develop a sustainable solution to capture CO2
texttitle: Introduction
information: >-
  The 3C technology captures CO₂ at a lower cost and in a more
  environment-friendly way than conventional methods. Installing the technology
  will lead to immediate reductions in carbon emissions.


  The technology aims to reduce capital expenditure by 50 per cent without
  losing capacity or efficiency. It also lowers operating expenses compared to
  conventional capture plants.


  The 3C technology can be installed on most of the existing sources of carbon
  emissions. Globally, the emissions catchable with carbon capture and storage
  technology exceeds 10 billion metric tons per year.


  The 3C technology was invented in collaboration with Fjell Technology Group,
  Equinor, CMR Prototech and SINTEF. The development project was initiated by
  Equinor in 2007, while the first patent for the technology was granted in
  1999. The project is funded by Climit, the Norwegian governmental financing
  initiative for carbon capture and storage.


  2008-2014: The 3C technology was developed as a project under Equinor’s
  management.


  2015: Fjell Technology Group is given the role as project lead. Several
  project phases were launched under Climit and Equinor support.


  2018: The company Compact Carbon Capture AS was established, and all the IP
  and know-how was transferred from Equinor and Fjell Technology Group
  management periods to Compact Carbon Capture.


  2019: The development continued  in collaboration with all the partners
  Equinor, Fjell Technology Group, Sintef and CMR Prototech. The technology were
  now at a “10 tonne per day Pilot”-stage, and continued towards a market ready
  technology.


  2020: Several exciting things are waiting to happen, and interesting news are
  on the steps, including onboarding of several new partners.


  Currently we are heading three projects for capturing CO2.


  First project (now seperated as a single purpose company) is within the
  3C-area, using amine as sorbent. Our main goal is to reduce size and weight
  compared to traditional carbon capture Technology. The other two use Carbonate
  looping, featuring state of the art Nano-Technology.


  We have also recently started development of technology for Green Hydrogen
  production (Producing Hydrogen without emitting CO2).




  Our CO2 Capture Technology includes :




  Compact CO2 Capturing (Amine-based)


  Capturing CO2 using Nano Technology


  Green Hydrogen production
