texttitle: Introduction
information: >-
  Fjell Technology Group has been involved in technology development for CO2
  capturing since 2008. One of the solutions has been developed past the testing
  stage. The technology was organized in a separate single purpose company
  (Compact Carbon Capture - 3C) and acquired by Baker Hughes.


  In addition to 3C, FTG are developing two other projects for capturing CO2.


  One uses Carbonate looping, featuring state of the art Nano-Technology.


  The second applies to Green Hydrogen production (Producing Hydrogen without
  emitting CO2).


  This development takes place in close collaboration with scientific
  environments.
