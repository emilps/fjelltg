subtitle: A joint mission to develop a sustainable solution to capture CO2
texttitle: Introduction
information: "Fjell Technology Group has been involved in technology development for CO2-capturing since 2008. Currently we are heading three projects for capturing CO2.\r\n\n\rOne project is within the 3C-area, using amine as sorbent. Our main goal is to reduce size and weight compared to traditional carbon capture Technology. The other two use Carbonate looping, featuring state of the art Nano-Technology.\r\n\nWe have also recently started development of technology for Green Hydrogen production (Producing Hydrogen without emitting CO2).\r\n\n\rOur CO2 Capture Technology includes (click to learn more):\r\n\n\rCompact CO2 Capturing (Amine-based)\r\n\nCapturing CO2 using Nano Technology\r\n\nGreen Hydrogen production"
