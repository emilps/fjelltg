  Another Fjell P&W ECO Capture System is on its way to a salmon smoltfarm in
  Norway. The ECO Capture system is the environmental friendly solution for
  treatment of wastewater from aquaculture. 

  The ECO Capture system offers high capture rate without the use of polymers or
  other chemicals. The system that is loaded on the truck in this video has a
  capacity of above 100 m3 wastewater per hour.  On the video you see the SONECO
  electrocoagulation units of the Eco Capture System.
