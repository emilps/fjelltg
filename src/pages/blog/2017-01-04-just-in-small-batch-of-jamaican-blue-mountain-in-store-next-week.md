  Our CTO, Dr. Asbj√∏rn Strand, last week visited the factory of our strategic
  collaboration partner APC Presmet. The reason for the visit was to inspect the
  pressure test of a Fjell TD300 duplex rotor (TD300). The rotor will be put
  under vacuum and filled with 99.9% water. 

  The Turbo Disc dryer is 1 of total 5 dryers to be delivered to HVC Dordrecht
  in the Netherlands in the period 2021-2024.
