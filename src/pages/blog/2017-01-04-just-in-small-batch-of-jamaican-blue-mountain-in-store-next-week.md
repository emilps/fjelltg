  FJELL FRS TMD150 Sludge Dryer System soon to be shipped to our customer
  Andfjord Salmon. The TMD dryer is the most robust solution for fish sludge in
  the market. It handles the lack of fibres, varying ratio of feed residues vs
  feces and the troublesome glue phase of the sludge. In addition it demands
  minimal maintainance and supervision from the fish farmer.
