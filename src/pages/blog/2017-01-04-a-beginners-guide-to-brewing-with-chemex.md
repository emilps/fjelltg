description: >-
  The Salten Marine Resource (SMR) project is progressing well. SMR is probably
  the worlds first Fish Sludge Dryer Hub. At SMR a Fjell FRS TMD400 sludge dryer
  with capacity of 6000 tons of wet sludge per year (690 kg per hour) will do
  the drying job, bringing the sludge to 92-95% dry matter content (DM). SMR
  will from the start receive wet fish sludge (approx 25% DM) from 4 different
  Norwegian smolt farms.
