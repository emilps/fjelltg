  In the beginning of June Fjell Technology Group employees spent working hours
  to clean beaches for ocean plastic. We did this together with
  @inthesameboat.eco

  We collected 55 big sacks and a total of 440 kg of plastic. What a meaningful
  and great day❣️We challenge all other Norwegian companies to make a
  contribution to clean ocean plastic.
