  Our workshop at Power & Water is becoming rather crowded as we progress our 2
  new builds featuring the latest designs of our power supply and reactor range.
  It'll be all systems go later this month, and we are also busy preparing our
  integrated DB2 treatment unit for site next week! #busy #summer


  The first skid-mounted SonecoÂ® treatment system starring Fjell Technology
  Group AS blue (which we love by the way!) is looking great with a DB4i and
  DB2i reactor combination and Switch Mode Power Supplies and Controls on skid.
  This will be followed by a flocculation tank and DAF unit and delivered to
  Salten Smolt in Norway.
