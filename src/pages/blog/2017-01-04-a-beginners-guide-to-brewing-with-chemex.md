  Fjell Technology Groups (FTG) CEO Leif Gunnar Madsen celebrates 40 years as
  entrepreneur. There is a Norwegian saying which tells that life starts when
  you reach the age of 66 years. That far from true for this vital man.

  It is now 40 years since he played a central role in establishing the company
  Fjell Group, as a key employee in the Stord-Bartz enterprise. Stord-Bartz was
  a pioneer within processing equipment for industrial fish and fish cuttings.
  In 1997 Leif Gunnar acquired Fjell Industries and hired several of the key
  employees from Stord-Bartz in the years that followed. 

  In 2012 FTG decided to depart from their long term role as a supplier to the
  oil and gas industry. Leif Gunnar and FTG wanted to make a strategic shift to
  Green Technology.
