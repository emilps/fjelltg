description: "Norwegian salmon farming idustry started its amazing journey 50 years ago, in 1970. \nProducing Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is the most environmental friendly and energy efficient way of proucing meat proteins. 1 kilo of salmon can in some cases be made by less than 1 kilo fish feed, while a kilo of ox (bovine) beef  could demand 7-9 kilos of animal feed. This ratio is also reflected in the CO2 footprint which is very low for salmon farming per kilo meat produced. Now the industry do huge investments in new green Technology solutions and to increase production, further improve animal welfare and become even more sustainable. In 2019 close to 1,4 million metric tons of salmon were produced in Norway\U0001F973\U0001F44F\U0001F3FB\U0001F44F\U0001F3FB. @fjelltechnology applaudes for both the past and future plans, and contributes with green technology solutions to facilitate that the industry reach their ambitious goals for the future.
