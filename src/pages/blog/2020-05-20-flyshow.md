  Our CTO, Dr. Asbjørn Strand, har just finished an approved quality control of
  a BigBag with hygienisized and stabilized fish sludge from a Fjell FRS TMD
  Sludge Dryer System. The dried fish sludge will be mixed with dried sewage
  (also done with processing equipment from @fjelltechnology), and added
  minerals.

  @fjelltechnology supply state of the art solutions for dewatering & drying of
  both Municipal & Aquaculture originated waste water sludge.
