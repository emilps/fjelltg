  A soft ice machine? No, this is a running Environmental friendly wastewater
  treatment plant at a Norwegian smolt farm. The mass you see entering the tank
  has been captured from the wastewater without the use of polymer or other
  chemicals. The wastewater go through multiple steps of capturing, separation,
  thickening, and dewatering before it enters this tank. Next step is drying in
  a Fjell FRS TMD200 Sludge Dryer System. The dried sludge will become a part
  ingredient in the making of fertilizers.
