description: "This summer we won a 6 million € contract with a European Waste Water Treatment Plant. This week one of our project engineers 3D printed a model of @fjelltechnology suggestion (1:4 scale) of this MWWTPs new condensate handling system. \U0001F44F\U0001F3FB\U0001F9D1\U0001F3FB‍\U0001F3EB\U0001F44F\U0001F3FB. The video does not show the full brilliance of the design due to limitations in Instagram, but still very impressive. Mathematical inspiration from the animal kingdom!"
