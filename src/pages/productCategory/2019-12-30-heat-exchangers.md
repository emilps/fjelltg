title: Fjell Turbo Disc Dryer
subtitle: >-
  The distinct difference between the TD dryer and most other disc dryers is
  that staybolt welds (or welds of other means to maintain the integrity of the
  disc when exposed to internal steam pressure) is entirely on the inside of the
  disc. Fjell has in its process for drying with disc-driers a patented process
  solution reducing usage of steam with approx. 40% from normal driers.

  Advantages between Fjell TD Dryer vs. other Rotadisc dryers:


  Forged claws can be welded with high precision in flat position using robots. 


  Welds can be inspected with NDT before assembly. 


  Welds are not exposed to the material to be dried, thereby risk for stress
  corrosion cracking is eliminated. 


  Welds do not seal between pressurised and non-pressurised side. Thereby risk
  for steam leakage is eliminated. 


  Claws act as reinforcement beams in radial direction, thereby increasing the
  lateral bending strength of the discs, which reduces the risk for leakages in
  foot welds between discs (big problem with Rotadisc). 


  Smooth disc surface secures efficient self-cleaning and maximum heat transfer.
