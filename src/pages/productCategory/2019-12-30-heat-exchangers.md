text: "Biosludges and MWW sludges are known to be extremely tricky to dry because of their tendency to form glue phase. Municipal Waste Water Sludge is generally an extremely tough application with severe wear and tear on the drying equipment, but the Fjell Turbo Disc Dryer has proven to resist the extreme conditions since the first unit was installed in 2001\r\n\n\rThe distinct difference between the TD dryer and most other disc dryers is that staybolt welds (or welds of other means to maintain the integrity of the disc when exposed to internal steam pressure) is entirely on the inside of the disc. Fjell has in its process for drying with disc-driers a patented process solution reducing usage of steam with approx. 40% from normal driers.\n\nFjell Technology Group offers following dryer solutions for sludge:\r\n\n\rPart drying in Fjell Turbo Disc Dryer\r\n\nFull drying in Fjell Turbo Disc Dryer\r\n\nFull drying in TMD friction dryer\r\n\nPart drying in Fjell Turbo Disc Dryer followed by full drying in TMD friction dryer\r\n\nPart drying in Fjell Turbo Disc Dryer\r\n\nIn part drying, or scalping, the challenge is often the content of chlorides and acids, which can cause severe corrosion problems with the rotor. A particularly annoying problem in the industry has been stress corrosion cracking in welds. This is avoided in the Fjell Turbo Disc Dryer because of the unique design and manufacture:\r\n\n\r\n\n* Welds not exposed to external environment in dryer, thereby risk for stress corrosion cracking is eliminated.\r\n* Welds do not seal between pressurised and non-pressurised side. Thereby risk for steam leakage is eliminated.\r\n* Claws act as reinforcement beams in radial direction, thereby increasing the lateral bending strength of the discs, which reduces the risk for stress corrosion cracking in foot welds between discs.\r\n\nWe have delivered such processes to plants in Norway, Italy, Saudi-Arabia and Japan."
