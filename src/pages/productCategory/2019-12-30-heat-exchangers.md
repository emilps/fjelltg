title: Fjell Turbo Disc Dryer
subtitle: >-
  The distinct difference between the TD dryer and most other disc dryers is
  that staybolt welds (or welds of other means to maintain the integrity of the
  disc when exposed to internal steam pressure) is entirely on the inside of the
  disc. Fjell has in its process for drying with disc-driers a patented process
  solution reducing usage of steam with approx. 40% from normal driers.

text: "Advantages between Fjell TD Dryer vs. other Rotadisc dryers\r:\n\nForged claws can be welded with high precision in flat position using robots. \r\n\nWelds can be inspected with NDT before assembly. \r\n\nWelds are not exposed to the material to be dried, thereby risk for stress corrosion cracking is eliminated. \r\n\nWelds do not seal between pressurised and non-pressurised side. Thereby risk for steam leakage is eliminated. \r\n\nClaws act as reinforcement beams in radial direction, thereby increasing the lateral bending strength of the discs, which reduces the risk for leakages in foot welds between discs (big problem with Rotadisc). \r\n\nSmooth disc surface secures efficient self-cleaning and maximum heat transfer."
