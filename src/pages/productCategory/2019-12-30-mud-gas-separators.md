  Fjell designs several versions:


  Singlestage screw cooker


  Double stage screw cooker


  Typically first stage uses waste heat and second stage low pressure steam. 


  We deliver all the classic sizes of Stord SS type cookers from small units for
  a few MT raw material per hour to the large SS160/14 rated for 30 MT per
  hour.  For new installations, we recommend our special two stage screw cooker
  system with improved process control and more sensitive energy usage. This
  cooker system has proven to reduce stick water, suspended solids content, 
  give better process control and increase the oil yield from marine and animal
  raw material.
