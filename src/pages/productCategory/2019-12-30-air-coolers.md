text: "Fjell Technology Group has created technology for drying fish sludge and other types of wastewater and separating its contents for reuse. \r\n\nThe machinery can be installed at any land-based fish farming facility or wastewater plant. It can dry sludge from 0.1 per cent dry substance (ds) and up to 99 per cent ds.\r\n\nFjell’s dryer design is patented and market-leading, and for drying large volumes of sludge it is the most energy-efficient dryer available on the market.\r\n\nThe dried sludge is repurposed as an additive for producing fertiliser, or in other agricultural products that rely on nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus.\r\n\nFjell’s technology contributes to a circular economy by recycling heavy metals and nutrients from sludge and wastewater.\r\n\nThe solution helps fish farmers and municipal waste plants to minimise the need for waste management and transport, which cuts both costs and emissions from production and treatment processes."
