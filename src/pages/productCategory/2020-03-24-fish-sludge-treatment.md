  Fjell Technology Group has a unique combination of long experience and high
  competence, and is a leader in research and development in the industry. We
  can supply in equipment the full range from small setfish plants, to post
  smolt plants, land-based food fish plants and semi-closed and closed plants in
  the sea.


  The FTG Fishsludge Recovery System (FRS) system can dry sludge from 0.1 per
  cent Dry Matter (DM) and up to 99 per cent DM. 


  We use award-winning technology without chemical polymer for the purification
  stage of waste water from drum filter and possibly biofilter
  (electrocoagulation) and wastewater sludge from the purification stage with
  tested and reliable technology from partners.


  Fish sludge is very demanding to dry but the TMD mill is specially adapted to
  this demanding fat rich and fiberless material. Particularly the glue phase
  can be a problem, however the patented TMD mill is robust and resistant.
  System is also not sensitive to plant load (altered biomass), or changes in
  composition.


  The dried sludge is repurposed as an additive for producing fertilizer, or in
  other agricultural products that rely on nutrients such as nitrogen and
  phosphorus. Fjell's technology contributes to a circular economy by recycling
  heavy metals and nutrients from sludge and wastewater.


  The solution helps fish farmers and municipal waste plants minimize the need
  for waste management and transport, which cuts both costs and emissions from
  production and treatment processes.


  The plant requires minimal maintenance and supervision and delivers stable
  hygienized and stabilized sludge.


  TMD is offered with Thermtech (technology owner) and partner - electro
  flocculation is offered with Power & Water as partner.
