  Fjell Technology Group has a unique combination of long experience and high
  competence, and is a leader in research and development in the industry. We
  can supply equipment in the full range from small smolt farms, to post-smolt
  farms, land-based ongrowing fish plants, and semi-closed and closed ongrowing
  farms in the sea.


  The TMD Fishsludge Recovery System (FRS) can dry sludge from 0.1 per cent Dry
  Matter (DM) and up to 99 per cent DM. 


  We use award-winning technology without the use of chemical polymer for the
  purification stage of wastewater from drum filter and possibly biofilter
  (electro coagulation). Wastewater-sludge from the purification stage is then
  dewatered and then dried with tested and reliable technology. .


  Fish sludge is very demanding to dry but the TMD mill is especially adapted to
  this demanding fat rich and fiberless material. Particularly the glue phase
  can be a problem, however the patented TMD mill is robust and resistant. The
  system is also not sensitive to plant changes in biomass, waterflow, or in the
  composition of the sludge.


  The dried sludge is perfect as a part ingredient in the production of
  agrigultural fertilizers, as it is rich in nitrogen and phosphorus. Fjell's
  technology contributes to a circular economy by recycling vital nutrients from
  the wastewater.


  The solution helps fish farmers and municipal waste plants minimize the need
  for waste management and transport, which cuts both costs and emissions from
  production and treatment processes.


  The plant requires minimal maintenance and supervision and delivers stable
  hygienized and stabilized sludge.


  TMD is offered with Thermtech (technology owner) and partner - electro
  flocculation is offered with Power & Water as partner.
