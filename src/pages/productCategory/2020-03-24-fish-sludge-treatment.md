  Fjell Technology Group has created technology for drying fish sludge and other
  types of wastewater and separating its contents for reuse. 


  The machinery can be installed at any land-based fish farming facility or
  wastewater plant. It can dry sludge from 0.1 per cent dry substance (ds) and
  up to 99 per cent ds.


  Fjell’s dryer design is patented and market-leading, and for drying large
  volumes of sludge it is the most energy-efficient dryer available on the
  market.


  The dried sludge is repurposed as an additive for producing fertiliser, or in
  other agricultural products that rely on nutrients such as nitrogen and
  phosphorus.


  Fjell’s technology contributes to a circular economy by recycling heavy metals
  and nutrients from sludge and wastewater.


  The solution helps fish farmers and municipal waste plants to minimise the
  need for waste management and transport, which cuts both costs and emissions
  from production and treatment processes.
